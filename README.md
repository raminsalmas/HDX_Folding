Machine learning (ML) techniques were used in this code to predict secondary structures of amino acids in proteins. The model was trained with data from the Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), and its resolution was enhanced using the HDX modeller tool, which is obtainable on the HDXsite.
