This programme utilises machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the secondary structures of amino acids in proteins.  The model was trained using data from the Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), and its resolution was improved using the HDX modeller tool, which is accessible on the HDXsite. (https://hdxsite.nms.kcl.ac.uk/) The gradient tree boosting method was employed for the current version of this model, which outperformed all previous ML methods. Using the ROC-AUC score, the current version's accuracy on the testing set is assessed to be 75%.
