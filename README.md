Machine learning (ML) techniques were used in this code to predict secondary structures of amino acids in proteins. The model was trained with data from the Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), and its resolution was enhanced using the HDX modeller tool, which is available on the HDXsite. (https://hdxsite.nms.kcl.ac.uk/) The gradient tree boosting method was employed for the current version of this model, which outperformed all previous ML methods. The current version's accuracy on the testing set is 75%.
